Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
under terms compatible with the above MIT license:

The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier
and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.

The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright © 2008
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

The BSD PRNG implementation (src/prng/random.c) and XSI search API
(src/search/*.c) functions are Copyright © 2011 Szabolcs Nagy and
licensed under following terms: "Permission to use, copy, modify,
and/or distribute this code for any purpose with or without fee is
hereby granted. There is no warranty."

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
the standard MIT terms.

The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
interest of source tree size.

In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
license, and to use these files without any requirement of
attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

Bobby Bingham
John Spencer
Nicholas J. Kain
Rich Felker
Richard Pennington
Stefan Kristiansson
Szabolcs Nagy

all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.

This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.
